# To-do

- **Bascally fine** ~~Fix it so that the history of commands shows up like a normal IF~~
- ~~Do enough styling so it looks like an IF instead of a piece of shit~~
- Probably not this, even with Lorem ipsum I'm kind of sold on the idea that there's a way to write something here ~~Consider some kind of styling that looks more like text and the *contains* the preaction and reactions? Some way to fill the space out a bit more?~~
- Yes I do want to ~~Or do I want to write more extensively? Is there a writing opportunity here to say more at a meta level...~~
- For now I think that it's better NOT to have timing introduced ~~Work on the time of pre and re actions as well as the command, give it a more natural flow, consider the relationship of delays to storytelling~~

- Write one scene (paragraph-level preactions)
