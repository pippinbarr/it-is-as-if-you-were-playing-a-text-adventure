# To-do

- Fix it so that the history of commands shows up like a normal IF
- Work on the time of pre and re actions as well as the command, give it a more natural flow, consider the relationship of delays to storytelling
- Do enough styling so it looks like an IF instead of a piece of shit
- Write one scene
